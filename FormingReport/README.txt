Forming report is an application I developed as a means to replace the pen and paper forms that my place of employment required us to maintain throughout the shift. I developed it gradually while I gained new programming skills. Largely, the application was intended to be a mock-up as a means of pitching the idea to the managers of the company and show them what could be done through software while reducing the space, time, error, and monetary costs of keeping records on paper.

The application uses GUI programming to input data into tables. In turn, the table information is stored inside a sqlite database. The ultimate goal was have a central mysql database to store all records for every machine that is required for the Safe, Quality Foods certification the company had.
